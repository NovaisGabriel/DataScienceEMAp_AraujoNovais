        "# The relation between criminality and rent prices: a case study of Airbnb in Chicago\n",

        "\n",
        "The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between the prices of Airbnb listings in Chicago and records of criminal occurences in the city for the period of July 2018 to July 2019.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why Airbnb? Because price rates are very dynamic, since they operate on a short-term supply-demand equiilibrium, can change daily and can respond almost instanteneously to factors such as criminality, in particular. While some caveats have to be made, since Airbnb listings are likely to be closer to touristic spots and to be less present in poorer neighbourhoods, most listings are made available for most of the year, which suggests host are likely to operate following a short-to-mid term optimization logic. This is not meant as an accurate proxy for long-term (traditional) renting, but as an insight into how the decision-making process (hosts deciding at which prices to list their places for each date, consumers deciding which places to rent given price, location and other factors) can be affected by surrounding criminality. \n",
        "\n",
        "How are we doing it? We're going to estimate via linear regression a relationship between 1) prices and nearby criminal occurences, for each day in our sample where we have information on both crimes and Airbnb listings  and 2) variations on listed prices and on nearby criminal occurences, for the listings whose prices were changed by the hosts between the first posting of the listings and the actual renting date.  \n",

While users may take a day or two to post their reviews, since prices don't vary much from day to day (even though it changes throughout the year), we assume any imprecision here is irrelevant on the aggregate."

        "We extracted our data on crimes for the city of Chicago from the Chicago Data Portal website, which amongst its Public Safety data features a dataset named \"Crimes: one year prior to present\", which lists all reports of criminal occurences for an entire year up to the latest update (roughly a week before the present date). For the version of this file saved on our GitHub, data spans from July 9th, 2018 to July 8th, 2019. We decided to drop data from July, 2019 since the its few entries seem incomplete, listing only a handful of occurrences.\n",
        "\n",
        "We decided to discard crimes of certain categories such as 'deceptive practice' (e.g. credit card frauds) and 'liquor law violation' (e.g. selling alcoholic drinks without a permit), which we deemed to not be relevant when it comes to the decision-making process from both hosts and consumers in regards to rent.\n",
        "\n",
        "When checking how many occurrences there are on our dataset for each crime category (as listed by the Chicago Data Portal), it can be seen that the most frequent crimes are related to stealing private possessions ('theft','burglary', 'robbery', 'motor vehicle theft'), criminal damage and physical violence ('battery', 'assault'), while the number of homicides pale in comparison (which can be at least partially attributed to less reporting, as public information would suggest many more homicides happened on Chicago for that time period).\n",
        "\n",
        "Since some types of crimes are much more reported than others, the relation between aggregate criminality and prices might be unclear and dominated by the categories with more representation. For example, we'd expect the correlation between price and nearby homicides to be negative, but the correlation between theft and price might actually be positive since higher rent prices are likely to be present in richer areas or more populated areas, where thefts might be more present (or at least, reported more often).\n",
        "\n",
        "To make a more thorough analysis, we'll deal with the full set of criminal occurrences as well as subsets for crimes related to physical violence, stealing property and homicides.\n",
