## Master

- FDS-part1_data.ipynb: first part of the code, related to importing, cleaning, organizing and preparing the data
Obs: all notebooks below use data generated from this notebook, so it's recommended to run this first. However, Google Drive links are provided so the datasets relevant for each notebook below can be downloaded without having to run the part 1 code.

- FDS_part2_stat.ipynb: second part of the code, related to the statistical analysis of the data from part 1
- plots.ipynb: code for plots generated for the project website
- map_"""".ipynb: each notebook generates one of the maps on the project website

## Folders
- Dados: raw datasets obtained from insideairbnb.com and the Chicago Data Portal
- Imagens: images for our website
- Site: files (.zip) related to the website layout (hmtl, css, etc)


# How to run
Each notebook can be run individually, but it's recommended to run 'FDS-part1-data.ipynb' followed by 'FDS_part2_stat.ipynb'. The other notebooks simply generate plots for the website, and don't add any new information.

## Needed to run
Numpy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, MatPlotLib, math, decimal, ast, Seaborn, SciPy, Statsmodels.api, bokeh
